# Forecasting-Unemployment-Rate-Using-a-combined-ARIMA-and-LSTM-Approach
Predicting unemployment involves using historical data and macroeconomic factors to estimate the value of the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labor force. This study proposes a hybrid approach of combining the strengths of a statistical model like ARIMA and a deep learning model like LSTM to accurately predict the unemployment rate especially in economic crisis like COVID-19 pandemic. A combination of financial indicators of United States datasets, spanning from 1979 to 2023 are used to train the model to predict unemployment rate. Along with ARIMA- LSTM hybrid model, standalone models of ARIMA and LSTM were also implemented and evaluated using the performance metrics. The objective of this research also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8 since by predicting unemployment this study will aid in inclusive and sustainable economic growth and ensure productive employment and decent work for all.
